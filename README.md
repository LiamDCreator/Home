  <summary><strong>ðŸŽ® Projects</strong></summary>

  - **A Cookie's Quest** â€“ A Cookie's Quest is an endless 2D arcade game developed in Unity and published on the Play Store. I designed and built this game as a way to complete a fully realized small-scale project, allowing me to become familiar with every stage of the game development process â€” from concept to release. I knew I would inevitably work on larger games in the future, so this project was a valuable way to prepare for that growth. Publishing the game on the Play Store was not only a way to share my creation with others, but also a meaningful test to see if my work met the standards required for public release, while gaining insight into the publishing side of game development.    
    *Technologies:* Unity, C#, Git, milanote, aseprite, ableton 12  
    *Solo project â€” built from concept to release. Only used assets for background and sound effects. Everything else is 100% made by me*
